# custom-gauge-practice

This is my repo for practice to make custom gauge using React Native 

If this custom gauge is like what you are looking for, you can view my code at App.js

I used some library to make this custom gauge:

1. responsive screen 
  https://github.com/marudy/react-native-responsive-screen
2. animated circular progress
  https://github.com/bartgryszko/react-native-circular-progress

here is an example of this custom gauge.
